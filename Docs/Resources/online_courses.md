[Pre-University Calculus](https://www.edx.org/course/pre-university-calculus-delftx-calc001x-2) | Bart van den Dries, Roelof Koekoek, Wolter Groenevelt and Fokko van de Bult | TU Delft | Pre-university Calculus will prepare you for the Introductory Calculus courses by revising four important mathematical subjects that are assumed to be mastered by beginning Bachelor students: functions, equations, differentiation and integration.
[Essence of Calculus](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) | 3Blue1Brown | Youtube | Very intuitive videos for understanding calculus.
[Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) | 3Blue1Brown | Youtube | A new approach to understanding Linear Algebra topics like vectors, matrices and their operations and how to visualize them.

## Mathematical Modelling
Title | By | From | Summary
------|----|------|---
[Mathematical Modelling Basics](https://www.edx.org/course/mathematical-modeling-basics) | Marleen Keijzer, Dennis den Ouden-van der Horst, Iris Smit and Kees Vuik | TU Delft | The course is for anyone who would to use mathematical modelling for solving real world problems. It suits business owners, researchers, students.
[Introduction to Differential Equations](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-differential-equations-bux-math226-1x-1) | Paul Blanchard and Kyle Vigil | Boston University | This course follows a modern dynamical systems approach to the subject. In particular, equations are analyzed using qualitative, numerical, and if possible, symbolic techniques.
[Introduction to Differential Equations](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-differential-equations-mitx-18-031x) | David Jerison, Arthur Mattuck and Haynes Miller | MIT | Develop the mathematical tools needed to solve linear differential equations. In the case of nonlinear differential equations, you will employ graphical methods and approximation to understand solutions.
